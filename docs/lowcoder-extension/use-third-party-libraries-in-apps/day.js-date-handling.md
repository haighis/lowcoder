# Day.js Date handling

Day.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times, designed to be a simpler and smaller alternative to Moment.js.

Day.js is already included in Lowcoder, so you can directly begin using it to work with dates and times by creating Day.js objects using `dayjs()`. This function accepts various formats, including strings, Date objects, and UNIX timestamps, allowing for flexible date and time manipulation such as adding or subtracting time, formatting dates, and comparing dates.


You can read how to use Day.js in their excellent Documentation here: [https://day.js.org/docs/en/get-set/get](https://day.js.org/docs/en/get-set/get)
